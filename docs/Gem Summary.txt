PROJECT TRELLIS: MASTER DESIGN DOCUMENTArchitect: Systems Architect & Multimedia Learning SpecialistDate: February 2026Vision: To architect a holistic life operating system based on Permacognition principles, fractal growth, and community pollination.PART 1: THE STRATEGIC MANDATEThe Core Philosophy: PermacognitionWe are moving away from linear, factory-model education and productivity. We are building a Regenerative System.The Compass: Permacognition (The 7-Module Spiral of Growth).The Map: The Ontology Nexus (Land, Sea, Sky).The Goal: Sovereignty (Time, Financial, and Relational).The Business Model: IP Asset ManagementTransitioning from "Labor" (Hourly work) to "Ecosystem Architecture" (High-ticket IP).The Product: The Trellis App ($99/mo) - The "Engine" for family growth.The Service: The Sovereign Family Consultancy ($15k) - The "Architect" installing the system.The Content: The Architect's Log (Substack) - The "Philosophy" that attracts the tribe.PART 2: THE BRAND IDENTITYName: TRELLISConcept: A support structure that allows organic life to climb higher. We do not force growth; we provide the framework for it.Visual Style: Naturalist meets Futurist. High-fidelity, hand-painted 3D botanical art within a clean, architectural interface.The Ontology (The Operating System)LAND (The Foundation): Spiritual, Physical, Psychological, Passion. (Self-Care).SEA (The Exchange): Intellectual, Financial, Career. (Resource Generation).SKY (The Atmosphere): Family, Social, Environment. (Connection & Legacy).The Plant Archetypes (Project Avatars)Users choose a plant that matches the "Energy" of their goal. The app procedurally grows this plant from seed to harvest.The Sunflower (The Visionary): For creative, spiritual, or intellectual clarity.The Oak Tree (The Builder): For legacy, financial foundations, and long-term systems.The Cactus (The Survivor): For resilience, health recovery, and efficiency in scarcity.PART 3: THE CONTENT ECOSYSTEM (Substack)The Manifesto: "The Tri-Sovereignty Protocol"Hook: "You have conquered the Sea (Career) but lost the Land (Health). Let's fix the architecture."Offer: A transfer of technology to build a sovereign family life.Article 1: LAND (The "Good Day" Protocol)Concept: You don't need more discipline; you need a biological algorithm.Story: How we engineered peace in an RV with 4 kids by respecting biological inputs (Morning Anchors, Outside Time).Article 2: SEA (The Strategic Sacrifice)Concept: Don't optimize your cage; build a boat.Story: Trading immediate income for Capacity. Moving from paper invoices to automated remote work to buy freedom.Article 3: SKY (The Healing of Horizons)Concept: Knowing when to Fly and when to Root.Story: Using travel for novelty therapy, then pivoting to the heritage farm for legacy. Listening to the family ontology.PART 4: THE APPLICATION FEATURES1. The Permacognition Engine (Fractal Cycles)Every project follows the 7-Module Growth Cycle:The Seed: Discovery & Alignment.The Soil: Knowledge Accumulation.The Stem: Experiential Learning.The Leaves: Prefrontal Insights (Patterns).The Bloom: Community Extension.The Fruit: Utilizing Abundance (Trade).The Harvest: Synthesis & Sharing.2. The Daily Flow (Autopilot)Logic: Tasks are not sorted by time, but by System Balance.If "Land" scores are low, Physical tasks automatically float to the top.Integrates with existing calendars but overlays "Permacognition Priority."3. Family Ecosystem & Community LatticeLeader Mode: Parents can guide children’s projects from a central hub.Pollination: Projects can be shared with specific circles (Work, Church, Town) for mentorship ("Grafting") or support ("Watering").4. "The Guide" (AI Mentor)A context-aware AI that knows which Module/Plant you are in and asks Socratic questions to unblock you.PART 5: THE FINAL CODEBASE (Trellis v1.0)Complete React Application Code including 3D Art Engine, Family Logic, and Community Features.
